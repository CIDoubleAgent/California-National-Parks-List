# AirTank - Coding project for prospective front-end developers
The front-end team at AirTank would like to get a better picture of your coding and problem solving
skills. To do that, we would like for you to create a single web page. Keep the following in mind:<br>
❖ Your future peers will be reviewing your submission, so write it appropriately and follow best
practices.<br>
❖ We've given a lot of latitude on design decisions. However, our primary focus of the
evaluation will be your code.<br>
❖ This single page should be responsive and look good on viewports ranging from narrow
phone displays to wide desktop monitors.<br>
❖ You can assume the latest browsers.<br>
❖ Include at least one external font<br>
❖ Use Sass with partials for header, hero, cards, and footer
## Description
Create a single webpage that displays the first 12 national parks in California from the National Park
Service API.
### Page features
1. Header with logo
2. Hero section with background image and page title
3. Grid of cards, one for each of the national parks returned from the API (No more than 4
cards in each row)
4. Footer
### Park card grid
Display each park in a card format with the following information:<br>
❖ Name of the park<br>
❖ Park description (you may truncate)<br>
❖ Image<br>
❖ GPS coordinates in the format "43.496 N 70.449 W"<br>
❖ First three activities listed<br>
❖ Link to park page on NPS website
### Footer
The footer consists of four sections:
1. Copyright year
2. Legal links (Privacy Policy, Term and Conditions)
3. Page title
4. Social links
You can have the links point to wherever you want. The sections should be laid out on wide
viewports with the legal links on the left with copyright year just below them, page title centered at
the top, and social links right aligned on the right side.
